explanation: "<div class='caution-box'>\nUPDATE 04/2021: Is Samsung now killing even foreground services? Could this be real, or is it a chimera?<br>\n<a href=\"https://github.com/urbandroid-team/dont-kill-my-app/issues/307#issuecomment-827649020\">Here you can read more details</a><br>\n<br>\nEven disabling the system battery restrictions does not save the app from being killed. Let's find out, if it is a bug or a feature...\n</div>\n<div class='caution-box'>\nUPDATE 2021: Despite Android team promise to enforce OEMs to be transparent about non-standard app killing, in Android 11 Samsung has introduced a new severe (default ON) restriction. Apps can no longer hold wake lock in foreground services. This breaks many use-cases, for instance health apps are now unable to gather sensoric data for their users.\nSee details <a href=\"https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/179644471\">here</a> and read below for workarounds.\n</div>\nWe record significantly increased number of app killing on Samsung's Android Pie flavor. The hints show adaptive battery being much more eager than in stock Android.<br>After 3 days any unused app will not be able to start from background (e.g. alarms will not work anymore). Imagine, you won't use your alarm clock for a the weekend +1 day and bang! no alarms any more and you miss work! We strongly suggest to turn off <strong>Adaptive battery</strong> and <strong>Put apps to sleep</strong> options per instructions below.\n<br><br>\nImportant: The latest feedback suggests even when those options get disabled, Samsung may re-enable them later after a firmware update!\nYes, Samsung - a dominant vendor in the Android market - is now using one of the nastiest battery saving techniques in the industry. They kill background processes and render alarm clocks and other apps which rely on background processing useless. See below for workarounds.\n<br>\n<br>\nNOTE: It is very hard to keep up with all the changes in the system settings layout and their modifications across all the combinations of phones and Android versions. If you find a different layout, or different name, let us know."

Although such feature might be useful, in some cases you don't wish to loose all background processed. This can results in termination of background processes when you play games (for example blue light filter apps will stop, or notification are delayed).\n<br>\nThere are Game Booster app, Game optimizing service, and Game Launcher.\n<br>\n1. Go to Apps and then click the Samsung app settings. Scroll to the Game Booster.<br>\n2. Turn off as much as you can. Then click Block During Game and shut off everything.<br>\n3. Next, in apps, find the game optimizing service - this cannot be disabled, but you can remove all permissions.<br>\n4. Last, search apps again and find the Game Launcher. You can remove the permissions and then disabled it.<br>\n<div class=\"img-block\">\n  <figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/img/samsung/game_booster_1.jpg\">\n    <figcaption>1.
