### App pinning / App locking

When you open the recent apps tray, drag your app downwards (it will be locked). So, even if you clear recent apps, it will not clear them from the background. Drag downwards again to clear your app from the background. <br>
On some phones, you need to long-press Your app and then choose the padlock icon from the menu:

### MUIU Optimizations

MUIU Optimizations were reported on MUIU 12 so far, but it is possible this option is present on older versions too (let us know, if you have found this option on your phone). It is hidden in the Developers settings, so you need to switch to developer mode first (10x tap on MIUI version in About phone).

### Hidden settings

On some XiaoMi phones, several settings options are hidden from you. Luckily, there are several apps on Play Store designed specifically for revealing these secret options and menus.
