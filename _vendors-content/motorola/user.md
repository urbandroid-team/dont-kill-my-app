## Adaptive battery

The Adaptive battery might be quite aggresive on some phones. It is designed for "infrequently used apps", but from the feedback it looks like the definition of infrequently used apps is quite wide.

1. Go to your phone's settings.
2. Open the Battery section.
3. Disable the Adaptive battery option.


## Background activity restrictions

There can be a restriction on background activity enabled for each app. 

1. Go to your phone's settings.
2. Scroll down and tap on 'Apps & notifications'.
3. Tap on the your app.
4. Tap on 'Advanced'.
5. Tap on 'Battery'.
6. Tap on 'Background restriction' or 'Background limits'.
7. If it says 'Background activity restricted', tap on it and then tap 'Remove'.

## Managing background apps

This option does not seem to be found in the layout, but rather with the search tool...

1. Go to phone preferences and type "managing background apps" in the search bar. This is kind of an app where you can select apps that you want to run in the background.
2. Switch the toggle to the active position to allow the app in the background.
