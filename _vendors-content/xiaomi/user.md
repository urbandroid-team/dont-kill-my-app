### App pinning / App locking

When you open the recent apps tray, drag your app downwards (it will be locked). Locked/pinned apps will gain further protection and not be cleared from the background, even if you clear recent apps. Drag downwards again to clear your app from the background. <br>
On some phones, you need to long-press Your app and then choose the padlock icon from the menu:

</div>

Another method of app locking is hidden a little deeper:

### Autostart permission

On MIUI 14, there is a new permission to start from the background for each app, in *Settings > Apps > Your app > App permissions > Background autostart*.

</div>

### Boost speed

If the app is locked here in this "Boost speed" feature, it may be spared by *Ultra battery saver*.

### MIUI Optimizations

MIUI Optimizations were reported on MIUI 12 so far, but this option may be present on older versions too (let us know, if you have found this option on your phone). It is hidden in the Developers settings, so you need to switch to developer mode first (10x tap on MIUI version in About phone).

<div class="img-block">

  <img src="/assets/img/xiaomi/miui_opti.gif">

</div>

There were some reports, that the MIUI optimization was missing in the menu - [here is a workaround guide](https://piunikaweb.com/2021/04/19/miui-optimization-missing-in-developer-options-try-this-workaround/).

### Hidden settings

On some XiaoMi phones, several settings options are hidden from you. Luckily, there are several apps on Play Store designed specifically for revealing these secret options and menus.
