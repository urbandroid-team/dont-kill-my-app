## Oppo F1S

Background services are being killed (including accessibility services, which then need re-enabling) every time you turn the screen off. So far, a workaround for this is:


* Pin your app to the recent apps screen.

* Enable your app in the app list inside the security app's "startup manager" and "floating app list" (com.coloros.safecenter / com.coloros.safecenter.permission.Permission).

* Turn off battery optimizations.

* Give the service a persistent notification to remain in the foreground.

All four of those need to be done before the app would function.
