The evil app on Asus is called *Power Master* - see the screenshots below. To make sure apps background processing works, set up the following:


* Uncheck **Mobile Manager > PowerMaster > Settings (or Battery-saving options) > Clean up in suspend** 

* Uncheck **Mobile Manager > PowerMaster > Settings (or Battery-saving options) > Auto-deny apps from auto starting**. 


See below for screenshots.
