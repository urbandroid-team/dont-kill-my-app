### Lenovo P2


Lenovo P2 has a very good battery life, but at a cost.


For an app to work in the background:

* enable the **padlock icon** at an app in the right top corner in the overview of running apps. It's only then actually running as a foreground process. If you swipe it away, its background process will be killed mercilessly.


It does not matter if the battery/power optimization is on or off in **Settings -> Apps -> Your app -> Battery**.
