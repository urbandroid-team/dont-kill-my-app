### App locking

Locking the app in the Recent app may avoid the app to be killed in background and the *Battery optimisation* setting to be reverted.
<br>

This is however not 100%. You may have to check system settings every once in a while. See [a bug report filed to OnePlus](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/in-battery-optimisation-apps-are-getting-automatically-switched-from-not-optimised-to-optimised.849162/).


1. Start the app you want to protect. Go to *Recent apps* - swipe up and hold for opening recent apps (Apps switcher).

2. Long press anywhere on the window and tap the *Lock* button on the upper right corner of the app.

3. The locked app will have the closed padlock icon.

### Battery optimization

- Turn off **System Settings > Apps > Gear Icon > Special Access > Battery Optimization**.
<br>
<small>**WARNING:** Recently OnePlus phones started reverting this setting randomly for random apps. So if you set it to be *not optimized*, the next day it may be back to *optimized*. 
<br>
To avoid the system to automatically revert the *not optimized* setting, you must also lock the app into the 'Recent App' list, see the solution above or [here](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=78588761&postcount=7).
<br>


- Turn off **System settings > Battery > Battery optimization**, switch to 'All apps' in top right menu **> Your app > Donâ€™t optimize**
<br>
<small>**NOTE:** Some of our users indicated that you need to disable Doze mode in Developer options in 1+3 and earlier.</small>


### App Auto-Launch

App Auto-Launch (on some OnePlus phones) essentially prevents apps from working in the background. Please disable it for your app.

### Enhanced / Advanced optimization

- OnePlus 6 and further: 
<br>
**System settings > Battery > Battery optimization > (three dots) > Advanced optimization**. 
<br>
You'll see two options there. Both are enabled by default:

1. Deep optimization or Adaptive Battery
<br>
This is the main app killer. 
If you need any apps to run in background, disable it.

2. Sleep standby optimization
<br>
OnePlus tries to learn when you are usually asleep, and in those times it will then disable the phone's network connections. 
This setting will prevent push notifications from being delivered.






- OnePlus below 6: 
<br>
Turn off **System settings > Battery > Battery optimization > (three dots) > Enhanced optimization**.
<br>
<small>**NOTE:** This should help with the problem where you lose Bluetooth connection to your smartwatch / fitness tracker (e.g. for sleep tracking).</small>

### Recent apps clearing behaviour

Normally when you swipe an app away, it won't close. Android handles that well on its own. On OnePlus this may however work in a different way. Recent app clear behaviour manager might be set up in a way that swiping the app to close will kill it.
